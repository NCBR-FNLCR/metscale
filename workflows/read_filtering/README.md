## Illumina read filtering and quality assessments with [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic), [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) and further processing with [Khmer](https://khmer.readthedocs.io/en/v2.1.2/user/scripts.html).

The tools within this workflow perform read filtering, adapter trimming, and quality assessment of paired-end Illumina reads, as well as additional functionalities. For more information, please see the [read filtering wiki page](https://github.com/signaturescience/metagenomics/wiki/3.-Read-Filtering).
